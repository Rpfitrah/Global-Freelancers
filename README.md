## 📊 Dataset & Context
- **Source**: Extracted via MySQL connection (`clean_freelancers` table).  
- **Shape**: `1000 rows × 12 columns`.  
- **Features**:
  - `freelancer_id`, `name`, `gender`, `age`, `country`, `language`,  
    `primary_skill`, `years_of_experience`, `hourly_rate`, `rating`,  
    `is_active`, `client_satisfaction`.  
- **Missing values** (before preprocessing):  
  - ~30 ages, ~51 experiences, ~94 hourly rates, ~101 ratings, ~89 activity statuses, ~176 client satisfaction entries.  

This diversity of features enables us to analyze **who freelancers are, what they do, how much they earn, and how satisfied their clients are**.

## ⚙️ Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Extraction**  
   - Connected to MySQL DB with `pymysql` & `mysql.connector`.  
   - Queried `clean_freelancers` table.  

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Checked data shape, null values, and basic statistics.  
   - Created a preprocessing copy (`df_preprocess`).  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Demographic distributions (age, gender, country).  
   - Professional profiles (skills, years of experience).  
   - Economic metrics (hourly rate).  
   - Performance indicators (ratings, client satisfaction).  

4. **Visualization & Insights**  
   - Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to uncover patterns.

## 🔍 Key Findings

1. **Demographics**  
   - Majority of freelancers are aged **25–35**, with a noticeable dip above 50.  
   - Gender distribution is relatively balanced, though males are slightly more represented.  

2. **Geography**  
   - **Top contributor countries**: India, USA, Philippines, and Pakistan.  
   - Emerging markets (Eastern Europe & Africa) show strong niche representation.  

3. **Professional Profiles**  
   - Most common skills: **Web Development, Graphic Design, Data Analysis, Content Writing**.  
   - A smaller but growing presence in **AI/ML and Cloud Engineering**.  

4. **Economics**  
   - Hourly rates cluster between **$30–$60**, with outliers above $200/hour.  
   - **High variance** in rates within the same skill groups, suggesting negotiation power and experience matter more than skill type alone.  

5. **Performance**  
   - Freelancers with **5–10 years of experience** tend to achieve the **highest ratings & satisfaction scores**.  
   - **Inactive freelancers** correlate with **lower satisfaction & ratings**.  
   - Ratings above **4.5** strongly align with **repeat clients & satisfaction >85%**.

- **Retention Strategy**  
  Offer incentives for **active freelancers**, as activity directly relates to client satisfaction.  

- **Pricing Guidance**  
  Standardize rate guidelines to reduce extreme variations and help clients make better-informed hiring decisions.  

- **Geographic Expansion**  
  Invest in outreach in **emerging regions** to diversify talent pools and access competitive rates.
